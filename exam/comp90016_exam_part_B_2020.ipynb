    "Conservation Biologists are investigating recent reliable reports of sightings of a Snark on a remote uninhabited island. Until now it had been thought that Snarks had been hunted to extinction at the end of the 19th Century, with the last reported expedition to locate them being unsuccessful. This expedition was documented in a 1872 report by Charles Dodgson.\n",

    "Available resources:\n",
    "-  \tThe Snark genome has not been sequenced but the Boojum genome sequence and associated annotation file is publicly available.\n",
    "-  \tA nearby museum maintains a collection of a small number of well-preserved authentic Snark hides and bones, from which DNA has been successfully extracted.\n",
    "-  \tResearchers have successfully extracted DNA samples from recently collected scat and fur samples from the island. These are thought to have come from Snarks.\n",
