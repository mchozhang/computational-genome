    "Well done on completing assignment 2! In general, students did a great job writing thoughtful written answers. The coding question was challenging, but many students produced correct translated ORFs to some if not all test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are pleased to say that only one or two students failed to upload a correctly formatted HTML file of their assignment along with their Juptyer notebook. This is a requirement for all future assignments. We will not be able to mark your assignment until you upload both files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most common mistakes.\n",
    "- Function output must be of the type specified in the instructions.\n",
    "- In genetic code 21, ATA encodes methionine but not an initiation codon. This led to some incorrect ORFs being identified.\n",
    "- The BLAST E-value is not a probability.\n",
    "- tBLASTn is required when searching a nucleotide database with a protein query.\n",
    "- Sensitivity is different to specificity. Sensitivity is not decreased if the number of false positive hits is increased.\n",

    "The sample solutions below provide a guide for students to compare to their own answers. These solutions are not the most efficient or succinct; they are written to be simple and easy to understand."
